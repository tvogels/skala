"""Direct, per-cycle timing of an SCF calculation.

Four nested layers are measured without sampling::

    xc_eval  in  numint  in  veff  in  cycle  in  kernel

``xc_eval`` is the functional evaluated to first order -- ``eval_xc_eff`` for
libxc, or ``get_exc`` plus ``torch.autograd.grad`` for a neural functional.
``numint`` is the whole exchange-correlation quadrature (feature construction,
the functional itself, and Vxc assembly), ``veff`` adds the J/K build, and
``cycle`` is one SCF iteration.

On CUDA the layers cannot be timed with a host clock. ``get_exc`` returns once
its kernels are *queued*, and the backward pass is queued immediately after with
no synchronization in between, so a host timer measures launch overhead rather
than work; the error grows with chunk size. :class:`Timeline` therefore takes
durations from CUDA events, which are ordered within the stream that executes the
work. Marks are still *created* in host program order, so attributing an interval
to a cycle stays a host-side decision; only the durations come from the device.
