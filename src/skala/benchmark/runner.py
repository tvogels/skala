    process-wide cost: the CUDA context, CuPy kernel compilation (compiled per

    repeats the exchange-correlation evaluation until its cost settles, which is

    Skipping any of them moves cost into the measurement rather than removing
    it: without stage 2 the first measured iteration grows by about half, and
    without stage 3 the first evaluation of the measured kernel carries the
    compile.

    The warmup is timed: ``load_ms``, ``warmup_ms``, and ``build_ms`` account
    for everything before the measured kernel, so the phases sum to

    TorchScript does not compile a graph on first use. It runs an instrumented
    graph for ``num_profiled_runs`` executions, counting down once per execution,
    and builds the optimized plan only once that count reaches zero
    (``ProfilingRecord::ready`` in the pytorch source). A differentiable module
    pays this twice, because the derivative graph is a separate executor that
    only starts counting when the forward one is done.

    Measured on an A100 with ``n = num_profiled_runs``, the expensive
    evaluations are the 1st, the ``n + 1``-th, and the ``2n + 1``-th, and the
    evaluations in between run at full speed::

        n=1:  450  216  888   50   50   50   49   49   50   49   48   48

    Waiting only for two consecutive evaluations to agree is therefore not
    enough: at ``n = 4`` the pair at the 3rd and 4th would stop the warmup and
    leave the compiles at the 5th and 9th to the measured run. So the number of
    profiled runs is read from torch and at least ``2n + 1`` evaluations are
    performed, with the stability test kept as a backstop for anything else
